MooX::Role::Parameterized - roles with composition parameters

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package My::Role;

    use Moo::Role;
    use MooX::Role::Parameterized;

    role {
        my $params = shift;
        my $mop    = shift;

        $mop->has( $params->{attr} => ( is => 'rw' ));

        $mop->method($params->{method} => sub {
            1024;
        });
    };

    package My::Class;

    use Moo;
    # experimental way of add roles
    use MooX::Role::Parameterized::With 'My::Role' => {
        attr => 'baz',
        method => 'run'
    };

    package My::OldClass;

    use Moo;
    use My::Role;

    My::Role->apply([{    # original way of add this role
        attr => 'baz',    # add attribute read-write called 'baz' 
        method => 'run'   # add method called 'run' and return 1024 
    }
     ,                    # and if the apply receives one arrayref
    {   attr => 'bam',    # will call the role block multiple times.
        method => 'jump'  # PLEASE CALL apply once
    }]);      

=head1 DESCRIPTION

It is an B<experimental> port of L<MooseX::Role::Parameterized> to L<Moo>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

This package exports four subroutines: C<role>, C<apply>, C<hasp> and C<method>. The last two are now consider deprecated and will be removed soon.

=head2 role

This function accepts just B<one> code block. Will execute this code then we apply the Role in the 
target class, and will receive the parameter list + one B<mop> object.

The B<mop> object is a proxy to the target class. It offer a better way to call C<has>, C<requires> or C<after> without side effects. 

The old way to create parameterized roles was calling C<has> or C<method>, but there is too much problems with this approach. To solve part of them
we add the L<hasp> but it solve part of the problem. To be clean, we decide be explicit and offer one object with full Role capability.

Instead do

  my ($p) = @_;
  ...
  hasp $p->{attribute} => (...);

We prefer

  my ($p, $mop) = @_;
  ...
  $mop->has($p->{attribute} =>(...));

Less magic, less problems.

=head2 apply

When called, will apply the L</role> on the current package. The behavior depends of the parameter list.

This will install the role in the target package. Does not need call C<with>.

Important, if you want to apply the role multiple times, like to create multiple attributes, please pass an B<arrayref>.

=head1 DEPRECATED FUNCTIONS

=head2 hasp

IMPORTANT: until the version 0.06 we have a terrible bug when you try to add the same role in two or more different classes.
To avoid this we should not call the C<has> method to specify attributes but the method C<hasp> (means 'has parameterized').

=head2 method

Add one method based on the parameter list, for example.

=head1 MooX::Role::Parameterized::With

See L<MooX::Role::Parameterized::With> package to easily load and apply roles.
