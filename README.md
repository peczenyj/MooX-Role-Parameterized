# SYNOPSIS

    package My::Role;

    use Moo::Role;
    use MooX::Role::Parameterized;

    role {
        my $params = shift;
        my $mop    = shift;

        $mop->has( $params->{attr} => ( is => 'rw' ));

        $mop->method($params->{method} => sub {
            1024;
        });
    };

    package My::Class;

    use Moo;
    # experimental way of add roles
    use MooX::Role::Parameterized::With 'My::Role' => {
        attr => 'baz',
        method => 'run'
    };

    package My::OldClass;

    use Moo;
    use My::Role;

    My::Role->apply([{    # original way of add this role
        attr => 'baz',    # add attribute read-write called 'baz' 
        method => 'run'   # add method called 'run' and return 1024 
    }
     ,                    # and if the apply receives one arrayref
    {   attr => 'bam',    # will call the role block multiple times.
        method => 'jump'  # PLEASE CALL apply once
    }]);      

# DESCRIPTION

It is an **experimental** port of [MooseX::Role::Parameterized](https://metacpan.org/pod/MooseX::Role::Parameterized) to [Moo](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo).

# FUNCTIONS

This package exports four subroutines: `role`, `apply`, `hasp` and `method`. The last two are now consider deprecated and will be removed soon.

## role

This function accepts just **one** code block. Will execute this code then we apply the Role in the 
target class, and will receive the parameter list + one **mop** object.

The **mop** object is a proxy to the target class. It offer a better way to call `has`, `requires` or `after` without side effects. 

The old way to create parameterized roles was calling `has` or `method`, but there is too much problems with this approach. To solve part of them
we add the [hasp](https://metacpan.org/pod/hasp) but it solve part of the problem. To be clean, we decide be explicit and offer one object with full Role capability.

Instead do

    my ($p) = @_;
    ...
    hasp $p->{attribute} => (...);

We prefer

    my ($p, $mop) = @_;
    ...
    $mop->has($p->{attribute} =>(...));

Less magic, less problems.

## apply

When called, will apply the ["role"](#role) on the current package. The behavior depends of the parameter list.

This will install the role in the target package. Does not need call `with`.

Important, if you want to apply the role multiple times, like to create multiple attributes, please pass an **arrayref**.

# DEPRECATED FUNCTIONS

## hasp

IMPORTANT: until the version 0.06 we have a terrible bug when you try to add the same role in two or more different classes.
To avoid this we should not call the `has` method to specify attributes but the method `hasp` (means 'has parameterized').

## method

Add one method based on the parameter list, for example.

# MooX::Role::Parameterized::With

See [MooX::Role::Parameterized::With](https://metacpan.org/pod/MooX::Role::Parameterized::With) package to easily load and apply roles.
